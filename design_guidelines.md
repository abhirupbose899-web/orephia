# Orephia Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Reference-Based Luxury E-Commerce**

Drawing inspiration from premium fashion platforms like Net-a-Porter, Farfetch, and Matches Fashion, Orephia will embody sophisticated minimalism with editorial-quality presentation. The design prioritizes generous whitespace, large-scale imagery, and refined typography to create an aspirational shopping experience.

**Core Design Principles:**
- Editorial elegance: Magazine-quality layouts with breathing room
- Visual hierarchy: Product imagery takes center stage
- Sophisticated restraint: Purposeful use of design elements
- Luxurious spaciousness: Generous margins and padding communicate premium positioning

## Typography System

**Hierarchy:**
- Display Headlines (Hero sections): Playfair Display, 56px/64px, weight 600
- Section Headings: Playfair Display, 40px/48px, weight 600
- Subsection Titles: Playfair Display, 28px/36px, weight 500
- Product Names: Poppins, 20px/28px, weight 500
- Body Text Large: Poppins, 16px/26px, weight 400
- Body Text Standard: Poppins, 14px/22px, weight 400
- Small Text/Labels: Poppins, 12px/18px, weight 400
- Button Text: Poppins, 14px/20px, weight 500, letter-spacing 0.5px

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use serif (Playfair Display) exclusively for headings to establish luxury positioning
- Maintain consistent line-height ratios for readability
- Reserve Playfair Display for emotional moments; use Poppins for functional content
